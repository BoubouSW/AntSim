# AntSim

<br>

## **Description**

<br>

This project is a collaboration between Cl√©ment Gilli and [Tom Pleskoff](https://github.com/TomP30). Our goal was to simulate the behaviour of different ant colonies, feeding their nest with sugar and fighting other colonies. We worked aproximatively 20 hours each one
